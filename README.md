In this project we are using the Kannada MNIST data found in https://www.kaggle.com/c/Kannada-MNIST/data
It is a handwriting recognition with the Kannada handwritten digits dataset, the data is  numarical data that represents  pixels for each image of the hand writing scripts. Problem type classification. I am thinking to test multiple architectures and will tray to report the feed-forward or CNN.
